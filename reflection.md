I worked on this assignment with Dani Forte

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
Our class represents an inside look into the game Mario. Using our personal experience with game we thought of different possibilities of what can happen within the game and how we can implement it. For example, we created attributes such as tokens and shrooms which is what Mario collects throughout the game and he uses those to be able to grow, fly, and shrink. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
Additional methods we used were player. We created this method because before you even start the game you usually choose the character you want to play with. In this case the player can choose between either Mario or Luigi.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
When starting this assignment at first we listed all the attributes we thought of when thinking of the game and commented what each of them represented within the game. This helped us plan out what our methods will do pertaining to the game. What didn't work was trying to change the type of variable we had like if one was int we tried to change it to string later on in the code which popped up errors. An advice I would give is first comment everything you are thinking of so you have a plan and when you return back to your code you don't forget where you left off.
